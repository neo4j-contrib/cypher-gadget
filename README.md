versal-cypher-gadget
====================

Versal course gadget for Cypher problem solving.



To run, you'll need to publish to versal with the sdk (since it depends on the course player for some things). 


TODO list:
=========

Task-checking logic
Frame d3 viz next to table better
d3 viz link labels (mostly implemented)
Relationship properties in query response table (easy)
Indicate node/link creation (node/links are visibly added but no text indication of this occurs)
Dismiss query-response table UI
Display empty db message after clearing the db
