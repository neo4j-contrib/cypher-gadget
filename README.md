cypher-gadget
=============

Online course gadget for Cypher problem solving.

There is no build process, just `coffee -c .` to compile from coffeescript and publish.


Tasks
========

You can either create tasks [here](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/cypher-gadget/blob/master/data/tasks.coffee) which will give you scripting access (will require to republish gadget) or you can input a json blob for tasks in the gadget's properties.

Here is an example task blob:


`{
  "message": "Lab: Find the 5 busiest actors in this dataset, use what you've learned",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "check": "input",
      "test": ":ACTED_IN",
      "failMsg": "Your paths should use the ACTED_IN relationship"
    },
    {
      "check": "output",
      "results": "Gene Hackman",
      "failMsg": "We expected someone else."
    }
  ]
}`

There are two types of task checks, "input" and "output," input checks the query text (as a case-insensitive regex) before it's sent. Output will check the response from the server in **only one** of two ways, either by checking the query response with "results" or by checking the entire graph with "test."

For example:

`{
  "message": "Create a node named 'Keanu Reeves'",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "check": "output",
      "results": "Keanu Reeves",
      "failMsg": "FAIL"
    }
  ]
}`

 will fail with `CREATE {name:"Keanu"}` because "results" checks the response that populates the gadget's query response table.  `CREATE (m {name:"Keanu"}) RETURN m` will succeed, however. As well, instead of "results", `"test": "Keanu Reeves"` in the json above will succeed because now it's checking against the whole graph.

Each input task will be checked in order, then each output task in order - if a task fails it will display the failMsg and **not** check subsequent tasks, so one error shows at a time.

The order of precedence for errors is:

- Syntax (generated by backed)
- Input
- Output "results" (check query response)
- Output "test" (check graph after query)
